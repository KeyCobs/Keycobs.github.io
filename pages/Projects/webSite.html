    <h1>KevinJacobs.eu (WIP)</h1>
    <p>
        This project is about my personal website. The one you are currently visiting. I've never been great at web development. But still wanted to try it out.
    </p>
    <h2>About the project:</h2>
    <p>
        I've taking advice from a YouTuber named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwUz3E9AW0w" target="_blank" >NetworkChuck</a> to create my own website.
        But I just didn't want to create a website from Wordpress. No I wanted to create one from scratch. I want to start with some basic HTML and CSS. I don't see
        any security flaws in this (There is no inlogging or anything) if anything this can just be a blog. Later on I want to create the site or update it useing Vue, React or angular. I wanted to showcase my work, my projects and I'll admit
        even brag a bit to my friends that I have my own personal website.
    </p>
    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p>
        I've never been great with Front-end development and this helps me with learning front-end. Next step would be converting the HTML over to either Vue and/or React.

        
    </p>

    <h2>What are the difficulties</h2>
    <p>
        I'm don't like developing website. I never did. The reason for this is because I can't create visual apealing sites, and because of this I can losse interest in it.
        I hope that this can change my way of thinking. I've learned more about responsiveness.
    </p>

    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>My first update for the blog post. I added bootstrap and I'm thinking of making more designs for the site.
        It appear that the hamburger menu is not functional sadly. I am going to update the site with the current version.
        Since I'm thinking it's better then before
